# AI/ML Thesis Java Project: FaceMesh Integration
## EYECURSOR: AN EYE-CONTROLLED SMARTPHONE SYSTEM INTEGRATING EYE TRACKING TECHNOLOGY WITH A HARDWARE INTERFACE FOR HAND/ARM IMPAIRED INDIVIDUALS

**Heads Up:** This project is directly connected to the [MediaPipe](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe.git) framework by Google AI Edge. In particular, our implementation leverages the FaceMesh solution located at:
